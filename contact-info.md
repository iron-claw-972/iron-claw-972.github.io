### Meeting Times

During the FTC season (September - December), we meet most black days in the LGHS metal shop after school (not Fridays) from 2-4pm. A complete list of meeting dates and times can be found on our [calendar]({{ site.calendar_link }}). Feel free to stop by any time if you have questions or concerns. You can even come to simply find out what awesome stuff we're doing that day!

The metal shop can be found in the Industrial Arts wing, which is across the street from the Small Gym and Math/Language building.
It is listed as room 704 in the "Practical Arts" wing at the bottom of the [LGHS campus map](http://www.lghs.net/about/campusmap.jsp).
