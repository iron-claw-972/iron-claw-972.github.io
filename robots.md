For the 2018 FIRST Power Up Season, our team built Copernicus. We competed in the San Francisco Regional and Central Valley Regional, winning our first competition ever at San Francisco. This qualified us for the Houston World Championship where we placed in the top half of our division. In the post-season, our team competed with Copernicus in the annual WRRF CalGames where we won our first offseason competition ever.

The 2017 FRC Season was our team's second season; our robot [Rockefeller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9hPIQuOPck) participated in [FIRST STEAMworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI) and competed in both Central Valley Regional and Silicon Valley Regional. At Silicon Valley Regional, we were selected as the first pick of the 8th seeded alliance and made it into the quarterfinals.

Iron Claw's 2016 FRC Season was our team's inaugural season; our robot [Bismarck](https://youtu.be/fl9a5ol2dcI) participated in [FIRST Stronghold](https://youtu.be/VqOKzoHJDjA), and competed in both Central Valley Regional and Silicon Valley Regional. At Silicon Valley Regional, we received a ranking of 25 out of 64 teams, which was very impressive for our team's first year. Everyone worked incredibly hard during both the build season and during the competitions and we were really happy with the results.
