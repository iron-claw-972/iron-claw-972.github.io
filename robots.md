The 2017 FRC Season was our team's second season; our robot [Rockefeller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9hPIQuOPck) participated in [FIRST STEAMworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI) and competed in both Central Valley Regional and Silicon Valley Regional. At Silicon Valley Regional, we were selected as the first pick of the 8th seeded alliance and made it into the quarterfinals.

Iron Claw's 2016 FRC Season was our team's inaugural season; our robot [Bismarck](https://youtu.be/fl9a5ol2dcI) participated in [FIRST Stronghold](https://youtu.be/VqOKzoHJDjA), and competed in both Central Valley Regional and Silicon Valley Regional. At Silicon Valley Regional, we received a ranking of 25 out of 64 teams, which was very impressive for our team's first year. Everyone worked incredibly hard during both the build season and during the competitions and we were really happy with the results.
