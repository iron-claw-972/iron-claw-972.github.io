### Would you like to join our team?

We meet most black days in the LGHS metal shop after school (not on Fridays) from 2-4pm. Feel free to stop by any time. No experience is necessary to be on the robotics team; we only request that you actively participate and contribute your thoughts and skills. The Robotics team isnâ€™t limited to only students interested in engineering: we are also looking for people with various other skills to assist us (such as photography, fundraising, graphic design, public outreach, etc.).

The metal shop can be found in the Industrial Arts wing, which is across the street from the Small Gym and Math/Language building.
It is listed as room 704 in the "Practical Arts" wing at the bottom of the [LGHS campus map](http://www.lghs.net/about/campusmap.jsp).

If you would like get in contact, you can [email us](mailto:contact@ironclaw972.org) or you can talk to [Mr. Payne](http://www.lghs.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=323473&type=u), the metal shop teacher.
