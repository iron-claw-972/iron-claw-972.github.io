### Would you like to join our team?

We meet most black days in the LGHS metal shop after school (not on Fridays) from 2-4pm. Feel free to stop by any time. No experience is necessary to be on the robotics team; we only request that you actively participate and contribute your thoughts and skills. The Robotics team isnâ€™t limited to only students interested in engineering: we are also looking for people with various other skills to assist us (such as photography, fundraising, graphic design, public outreach, etc.).
