### Would you like to join our team?

We meet most black days in the LGHS metal shop after school (not on Fridays) from 2-4pm. Feel free to stop by any time. No experience is required to be on the robotics team, you just need a healthy interest in robots or engineering.

The metal shop can be found in the Industrial Arts wing, which is across the street from the Small Gym and Math/Language building.

If you would like get in contact, you can [email us](mailto:contact@ironclaw972.org) or you can talk to [Mr. Payne](http://www.lghs.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=323473&type=u), the metal shop teacher.
