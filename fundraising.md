FRC is a very costly annual expense for many schools. Ours is no exception. In addition to the typical annual budget, we also have to make several pricy one-time purchases as a school that hasn't fielded an FRC team for several years. Despite the hard work we've poured into fundraising over the past year, we find ourselves in need of a little more money to compete this year (for items such as CAD and programming laptops, etc).
