## Who are we?

Iron Claw is a [First Robotics Competition (FRC)](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team run by the Los
Gatos High School Robotics Club. This is the team's second year at LGHS after being restarted. We look forward to
seeing our fellow teams this year at the Central Valley Regional and at the Silicon Valley Regional!

## Our History

Team 972 was founded as "Steel Paw" in 2002. You can see a video of their rookie year robot at the Silicon Valley
Regional [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSXVit1UKro). 972's name later changed to "Iron Paw".
Unfortunately, team 972 stopped competing in 2008 due to a lack of interest and the retirement of the lead mentor.
Students traveled to Pioneer High School's team 668, the [Apes of Wrath](http://www.apesofwrath668.org)
to continue participating in robotics.

Soon, enough interest built up for the Robotics Club to reform at LGHS. We participated as team 6730 in the
FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) in 2012. FTC is a smaller-scale and lower-cost robotics competition. In fall of
2014, the program grew enough for LGHS to field a second FTC team, 9097. At the end of the 2015 FRC season,
the Los Gatos High School Robotics Club decided to split off from Pioneer High School and the Apes of Wrath
due to fast-increasing interest in robotics and our team's growing size.

We are now restarting team 972 as "Iron Claw". Our mission is to develop and nurture interest in
STEM within the Los Gatos community and to teach our members real-life STEM skills, teamwork, and
[gracious professionalism](http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism).

Our team's former website can still be found [here](http://losgatosmanufacturing.com/clubs/robotics_team.php).
Our progress through the years can also be found at the [Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/972), a website that keeps team information, event results, and video from previous years for all FRC teams.

## 2016 FRC Season

Iron Claw's 2016 FRC Season was our team's inaugural season; our robot [Bismarck](https://youtu.be/fl9a5ol2dcI) participated in [FIRST Stronghold](https://youtu.be/VqOKzoHJDjA) competition, and competed in both Central Valley Regional and Silicon Valley Regional. At Silicon Valley Regional, we received a ranking of 25 out of 64 teams, which was very impressive for our team's first year. Everyone worked incredibly hard during both the build season and during the competitions and we were really happy with the results.

## 2017 FRC Season

The 2017 FRC Season was our team's second season; our robot Rockefeller participated in this year's [FIRST STEAMworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI) competition, and competed in both Central Valley Regional and Silicon Valley Regional. At Silicon Valley Regional, we were selected as the first pick of the 8th seeded alliance and made it into the quarterfinals.

## Robotics Class

Iron Claw started off the 2016-2017 school year by introducing Los Gatos High School's first-ever Robotics class. Students in the class have the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of robotics, including programming, electrical and mechanical skills, CAD, fundraising, and leadership. The class allows students to learn these invaluable skills in a classroom setting, while also preparing them for the upcoming FRC season. The elective is open to all students, and it gives students class credit to recognize them for their hard work. Students interested in the class should talk to Mr. Coppelli, the engineering/robotics teacher.
