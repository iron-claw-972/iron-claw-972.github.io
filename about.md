## Who are we?

Iron Claw is a <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc">FRC</a>
team run by the Los Gatos High School Robotics Club. This year (2016), we
will be restarting team 972 at LGHS. We hope to see all of our fellow teams
and students at Silicon Valley Regional in April 2016!

## Our History

Team 972 was founded as "Steel Paw" in 2002. You can see a video of their rookie year robot at the Silicon Valley
Regional [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSXVit1UKro"). 972's name later changed to "Iron Paw".
Unfortunately, team 972 stopped competing in 2008 due to a lack of interest and the retirement of the lead mentor.
Students traveled to Pioneer High School's team 668, the [Apes of Wrath](http://www.apesofwrath668.org")
to continue participating in robotics.

Soon, enough interest built up for the Robotics Club to form at LGHS. We participated as team 6730 in the
FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) in 2012. FTC is a smaller-scale and lower-cost robotics competition. In fall of
2014, the program grew enough for LGHS to field a second FTC team, 9097. At the end of the 2015 FRC season,
the Los Gatos High School Robotics Club decided to split off from Pioneer High School and the Apes of Wrath
due to many students' inability to transport on a daily basis and our team's growing size.

We are now restarting team 972 as "Iron Claw", featuring a fresh, new team while still retaining characteristics
of our old team. Our mission is to develop and nuture interest in STEM within the Los Gatos community
and to teach our members real-life STEM skills, teamwork, and
[gracious professionalism](http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism).

Our team's former website can still be found [here](http://losgatosmanufacturing.com/clubs/robotics_team.php"),
although nearly everything is outdated by now.
Our progress through the years can also be found [here](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/972") at the
Blue Alliance, a website that keeps team information, event results, and video from previous years for all
of FRC's teams.
