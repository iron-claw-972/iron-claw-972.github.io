## Who are we?

Iron Claw is a [First Robotics Competition](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc) (FRC)
team run by the Los Gatos High School Robotics Club. Our team number is 972 and our rookie year is 2016!
We hope to see all of our fellow teams at Silicon Valley Regional in April!

## Our History

Team 972 was founded as "Steel Paw" in 2002. You can see a video of their rookie year robot at Silicon Valley
Regional [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSXVit1UKro"). 972's name later changed to "Iron Paw".
Unfortunately, team 972 stopped competing in 2008 due to a lack of interest and the retirement of the head mentor.
Students traveled to Pioneer High School's team 668, the [Apes of Wrath](http://www.apesofwrath668.org")
to continue participating in robotics.

Soon, enough interest built up in LGHS for the Robotics Club to form. We participated as team 6730 in the
FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) in 2012. FTC is a smaller-scale and lower-cost robotics competition. In 2014, the
program grew enough for LGHS to field a second FTC team, 9097. We still participated in FRC with Pioneer
High School.

We are now restarting team 972 as "Iron Claw". Our mission is to grow interest in STEM in the Los Gatos community
and to teach our members real-life STEM skills, teamwork, and
[gracious professionalism](http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism).
