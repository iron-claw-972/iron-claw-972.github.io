## Build Season: Week Two

It’s officially week two of build season, and we switch gears from deciding on which robot to build to actually starting to design and fabricate the robot we’ve designed. Programmers have begun programming basic code, such as our drive code, and have been assigning roles to certain electrical parts and mechanisms. Our mechanical team is currently using CAD (Computer Aided Design) to design our robot digitally.

We’ve decided to use a West Coast (or tank) drive train on our robot and use two joysticks to control it. Our mechanical team has continued to finalize prototypes, and we are now perfecting mechanisms we wish to use on our final robot. The CAD team is deciding how these systems will be placed on our robot so we have optimal mobility and minimal weight. Various CADed robot ideas will be finalized this week and we will have a roughly completed CAD of our robot by the end of this Saturday, 1/21/17.

The programmers have begun writing basic drive code, vision/camera code, imputing values for joystick buttons and sensors, and practicing programming such as toggle code to use in the upcoming weeks of build season. The programming team, along with the mechanical team, has been using the kitbot (our practice robot) to test various codes and mechanisms. The mechanical team uses pneumatics that are quickly mounted onto the kitbot to test finalized and sophisticated prototypes, while the programmers use it to test their drive code, camera code, and sensors. The electrical team is working closely with the programming team to test new sensors and ensure we know how we’re going to use them on our final robot.
