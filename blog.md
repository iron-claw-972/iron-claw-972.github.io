## Week One: Kickoff Week!

This is the first of six weeks in build season, which is the period we have to design, program, build, and test our robot for competition. We made several prototypes of potential mechanisms our robot could have to compete effectively in the game, including a low goal shooter, high goal shooter, fuel and gear intakes, gear manipulator, and rope climber.

All of our veteran and new members gather together for brunch at school! We arranged this meeting to watch the game release video of this year’s FIRST Robotics Competition together. A few members gather together to discuss ideas and begin prototyping possible robot mechanisms. One of our members holds up a game piece and recommends strategies on how we may use this piece to our advantage. The fundamental prototype to our team’s potential manipulation of balls is an intake system to pick up balls from the ground to place in our robot. Part of this year’s FRC Competition, “2017 FIRST Steamworks,” includes picking up wiffle balls (“fuel”) from a hopper or the floor to score into a goal in a boiler. Our intake system consists of rotating belts that glide along the floor and pick up the balls, which are then placed in a holder in our robot.

Relating to our ball intake, another protoype we made was a ball ejecting system to score into the low goal of the boiler. Our prototype mechanism is made to eject balls that have been picked up from the ground using our ball-intake system. After our intake system successfully picks up fuel from the ground, the fuel is transported into a holder within our robot, and finally shot out with fly wheels when our robot is in front of the low goal.

In contrast to the low goal prototype, we also created a prototype of a high goal shooter. The high goal is a funnel-shaped pipe whose rim at the top of the boiler is approximately 8 feet above the ground. The pipe is backed by a net to catch any stray balls that may miss the entrance of the goal. Teams must shoot 3 high goals to score one match point during the teleoperated period.

This year’s competition end game involves the robots climbing a rope about 4 feet off the ground and having the robot touch a touchpad at the top of the rope, at which point the robot is prepared for takeoff. This climbing prototype was created with a bar and 4 long and thin pegs spaced apart 1.5 inches. The pegs and rotating bar allow for a rope to get caught, and continue rotating so our robot is hoisted up while the rope is coiled.
