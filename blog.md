<h2><a name="three">Week Three: Build Season</a></h2>

As Week 3 comes to an end, the team finalizes prototyping and CAD, and are now preparing to assemble the mechanisms for this year's robot. By using recent data from our prototypes, we have made several design changes to ensure the best integration of individual mechanisms to improve the overall efficiency of our robot.

Programmers are currently using last years robot, Bismarck, as well as our kitbot, a basic practice bot, to test both advanced and basic code. The programmers have started learning “PID” (Proportional Integral Derivative), which allows the robot to resist the force of other robots and to follow a precise track when performing tasks such as driving, shooting fuel, or moving obstacles. The programmers also intend to use a more accurate gyro and accelerometer this year, which allows the robot to simply drive or shoot to a certain distance based on an angle input into the code. This allows for a reliable programming plan for the intense 15-second autonomous period which starts the match.

The CAD team is finishing up the CAD for our robot. For the past week, the design team have been working non-stop in teaching new members CAD to contribute to the final design of our robot. Team leads have been busy ordering and buying essential materials. With your generous donations, we’ve bought nearly everything we need for our custom electrical board, a heaping load of metal to construct the robot, wheels, and other components that are necessary to our robot’s design.

Thank you all for your generous donations that have allowed us to build not only our robot, but also our team

<h2><a name="two">Week Two: Build Season</a></h2>

It’s officially week two of build season, and we've switched gears (no pun intended) from deciding which robot to build to actually designing and fabricating our robot. Programmers have begun programming basic code, such as our drive code, and have been assigning roles to certain electrical parts and mechanisms. Our mechanical team continues to use CAD (Computer Aided Design) to design our robot digitally.

We’ve decided to use a West Coast (or tank) drive train on our robot, using two joysticks to control it. Our mechanical team continues to finalize prototypes, and we are now perfecting mechanisms we wish to use on our final robot. The CAD team is deciding how these systems will be placed on our robot so we have optimal mobility and minimal weight. Various CADed robot ideas will be finalized this week and we will have a roughly completed CAD of our robot by the end of this Saturday, 1/21/17.

The programmers have begun writing basic drive code, vision/camera code, imputing values for joystick buttons and sensors, and testing programming techniques like toggle code to use in the upcoming weeks of build season. The programming team, along with the mechanical team, has been using the kitbot (our practice robot) to test various codes and mechanisms. The mechanical team uses the kitbot to test pneumatic systems for our finalized and sophisticated prototypes, while the programmers use it to test their drive code, camera code, and sensors. The electrical team is working closely with the programming team to test new sensors and to ensure we know how we’re going to use them on our final robot.

<h2><a name="one">Week One: Kickoff Week!</a></h2>

This is the first of six weeks in build season, which is the period we have to design, program, build, and test our robot for competition. We made several prototypes of potential mechanisms our robot could have to compete effectively in the game, including a low goal shooter, high goal shooter, fuel and gear intakes, gear manipulator, and rope climber.

Both veterans and new members gathered together for a team brunch at school! We arranged this meeting to watch the [game release video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwwnbLSW6hY) of this year’s FIRST Robotics Competition together. Some members gathered together to discuss ideas and begin prototyping possible robot mechanisms. The fundamental prototype to our team’s manipulation of balls is an intake system to pick up balls from the ground to place in our robot. Part of this year’s FRC Competition, [2017 FIRST Steamworks](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season), includes picking up wiffle balls (“fuel”) from a hopper or the floor to score into a goal in a boiler. Our current intake system consists of rotating belts that glide along the floor and pick up the balls, which are then placed in a holder in our robot.

![Fuel Intake Prototype](/assets/img/intake_prototype.gif)

To make use of the balls retrieved by the robot, we developed a protoype for a ball ejecting system to score into the low goal of the boiler. Our prototype mechanism was made to eject balls that have been picked up from the ground using our ball-intake system. After our intake system successfully picks up fuel from the ground, the fuel is transported into a holder within our robot, and finally shot out with fly wheels when our robot is in front of the low goal.

![Low Goal Shooter Prototype](/assets/img/lowgoal_prototype.gif)

In contrast to the low goal prototype, we also created a prototype of a high goal shooter. The high goal is a funnel-shaped pipe whose rim at the top of the boiler is approximately 8 feet above the ground. The pipe is backed by a net to catch any stray balls that may miss the entrance of the goal. Teams must shoot 3 high goals to score one match point during the teleoperated period. Although this is more complex than a low goal shooter, it is more efficient than shooting low goal, which requires three times the number of goals for the same amount of high goal points.

This year’s competition end game involves the robots climbing a rope about 4 feet off the ground and having the robot touch a touchpad at the top of the rope, at which point the robot is prepared for takeoff. This climbing prototype was created with a bar and 4 long and thin pegs spaced apart 1.5 inches. The pegs and rotating bar allow for a rope to get caught, and continue rotating so our robot is hoisted up while the rope is coiled during the endgame.
